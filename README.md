# 🌱 PLDG Cohort-4 Journey

Welcome to my documentation repo for the PLDG Cohort-4**!

This space is where I’ll be tracking my progress, learnings, wins (and maybe a few stumbles) as I dive into open-source contributions, community collaboration, and projects.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Deepen my understanding of open-source contribution workflows
- Collaborate on real-world projects
- Sharpen my technical writing and documentation skills
- Build, break, and build again 💪

---

## 📚 What to Expect

- Weekly updates on what I’m learning
- Notes and resources I find helpful
- Reflections and challenges
- Contributions and PRs I make during the cohort
- Anything else I find cool or worth sharing

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech

- Git & GitHub
- Markdown
- Open source projects
- Whatever else the journey throws at me!
